This project is my attempt at recreating the default Google search page for Web Development 101 through The Odin Project. Skills demonstrated include basic HTML usage, placement of items using CSS Grid and other styling of items using CSS. I tried to use developer tools in Firefox as little as possible in order to force myself to figure things out on my own so usage of some HTML elements may be non-standard.
